# One Page Portfolio Project

Rohan, Ryan, Joko and dylan

Our assignment was to create a single page website with a portfolio for a company made up of the members of our team.

The task requirements stated we needed to have 3 main sections of the page, as well as a navigation bar. The website also needed to be able to function to as close as full experience without Js, and be accessable to people who are either blind or visually impaired.

we started the project by planning the design of the page. we did this by drawing potential appearances on paper and whiteboard. we started by deciding how the navigation bar would work on the page, before planning the layout of each consecutive section. This included thinking about how it would look on both desktop and mobile.

We did this to ensure that when development of the website began, everyone would be aware of the direction each section should take in regards to looks and layout, ensuring that the site was created to be responsive as we advanced forward.
